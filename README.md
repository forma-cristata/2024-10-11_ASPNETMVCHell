# FAILED [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) MVC Inventory Management System

This repository contains my attempt at building an inventory management system using [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) 8 MVC framework for a school assignment. The project aimed to create a web-based system for managing store products with features like:

- Product management (CRUD operations)
- Store management
- Product-store relationship tracking

⚠️ **Note**: This project does not reflect my current capabilities or preferred tech stack. I have since focused on other technologies and frameworks that better align with my interests and strengths. I do not plan to pursue [ASP.NET](ASP.net) MVC development in the future.

## Intended Architecture

The project was meant to have three components:

- Main MVC Application (UI)
- API Service
- Shared Models Library

While the architecture was sound in theory, I encountered significant challenges with implementation and was unable to get the system working properly within the assignment timeframe.

## Technologies

- [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) 8 MVC
- Entity Framework Core
- MySQL
